# Saul Botman ⚖️

A sophisticated legal assistant powered by Streamlit and LLM technology, designed to provide accurate information about the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The chatbot leverages the Groq LLM and Google's Generative AI embeddings to deliver precise legal insights.

**🔥 Try it now: [Saul Botman Live](https://saul-botman.streamlit.app/)**

## Technical Stack 🛠️

- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS theming
- **LLM Integration**: Groq's llama3-70b-8192 model
- **Embeddings**: Google Generative AI (models/embedding-001)
- **Vector Store**: FAISS for efficient similarity search
- **Document Processing**: LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- **Memory**: ConversationBufferWindowMemory for context retention

## Features ✨

- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Streamlined conversation experience with legal context
- Vector-based similarity search for relevant IPC sections
- Real-time document retrieval and context analysis
- Conversation memory for maintaining context
- Custom prompt engineering for legal responses

## Installation 🚀

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NiteeshL/Saul-Botman.git
cd Saul-Botman
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure API Keys:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

To obtain the API keys:
- Get your Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Get your Groq API key from [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com/keys)

## Data Processing 📚

The system processes Indian Penal Code documents through the following pipeline:
1. PDF documents are loaded from the `legal_documents` directory
2. Documents are split into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 character overlap
3. Text chunks are embedded using Google's Generative AI
4. Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval

## Usage 💡

1. Place your IPC documents in the `legal_documents` directory

2. Run the data ingestion script:
```bash
python data_ingestion.py
```

3. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Query Processing Flow 🔄

1. User input is processed through the conversation chain
2. Relevant IPC sections are retrieved using FAISS similarity search
3. Context is combined with the user query using a custom prompt template
4. Response is generated using the Groq LLM
5. Conversation history is maintained for contextual responses
